# How to test anything

**Problem**: You are implementing a simple scheduler for a conference time block. 
Do this using classes if possible (not just functions in the global scope of a file). 
This is only to make the follow-up easier. All the learnings we have, are also applicable in more functional-oritented programming, too.

The domain is meant to be easy - assume that you can only pass valid data, no negative time, no 0 time. This time,
we have a very specific learning goal and that is **not** about finding all the corner cases etc.

When handling time, assume it's always minutes - again, let's keep the domain logic clear from corner cases we need to 
think in production code. This is not production code, rather a place for learning.
