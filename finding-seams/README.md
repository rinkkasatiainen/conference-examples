# Finding Seams

Each exercise starts from code that is hard to test and refactor. The goal is to learn to experience the legacy code dilemma:

> When we change code, we should have tests in place. To put tests in place, we often have to change code.
> - Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code

Your main goal in every module is to **make the code testable by introducing seams**, and only then start improving the design.

### What is a seam?

A **seam** is a place in the code where you can **change behavior without editing the calling code** – for example by injecting a dependency, wrapping a global, or adding an interface.  
In practice, seams let you **replace real collaborators with test doubles**, control time, random values, I/O, and external services so your tests are fast and deterministic.

For a short introduction, see Michael Feathers’ discussion of seams in “Working Effectively with Legacy Code”.

### Workflow for these exercises

Work through the exercises in this order (both in `javascript/` and `typescript/` versions as you prefer):

1. **`speaker-feedback`**
2. **`badge-printer`**
3. **`schedule-converter`**
4. **`reminder-sender`**
5. **`room-availability`**
6. **`speaker-profile-service`**

For **each** module:

1. **Understand what makes it hard to test**
   - Look at the code on each assignment and think what is the thing that makes it hard to test. Or that makes tests brittle (where e.g. the execution order affects)
   - Talk with you pair on what do you notice

2. **Identify and introduce a seam**
   - what are the ways to introduce seams? Identify at least 2 different options.
   - the goal is that you can control the behavior of the external dependency in you test.
   
3. **Refactor with safety nets**
   - Once tests exist around the key behavior, you can start refactoring (but that's not the goal of this exercise)

4. **For more challenging task**

   Imagine these are services used by numerous classes, not all of which are under your control. Imagine too, that the choice of your
   language does not support optional arguments for constructor (for constructor injection) - or that the constructor 
   already has many optional dependencies. And you just don't want to add an optional parameter.

   Thus,
   - you are **not allowed** to change the existing public interface by;
     - introducing a constructor injection (this is exactly what we'd do in production code)
     - add any optional (default) parameters to the public functions

## Tips

Here's some tips for the questions above:

1. **Understand what makes it hard to test**
    - Look for direct calls to time (`Date.now`, `new Date()`), randomness (`Math.random`), I/O (console, file system, network), global state, or static singletons.
    - Notice long functions, hidden dependencies created inside methods, and code that mixes domain logic with side effects.
    - 
2. **Identify and introduce a seam**
    - Decide *where* you need control in tests (e.g. time, random, HTTP, sensors, registries).
    - Introduce a seam such as:
        - **Dependency injection** (pass in collaborators through parameters or constructors instead of creating them directly).
        - **Interfaces / adapters** that wrap external services or globals.
        - **Wrapper functions** around time, randomness, or global APIs that you can stub in tests.
    - After adding the seam, write at least one test that uses it (e.g. by stubbing/mocking the dependency) to prove the code is now testable.

And tips for refactorings:

1. speaker-feedback:
   - identify what is easy to test block
   - identify what is hard to test block
   - "Extract something somewhere" and test the easy to test code.

2. badge-printer:
   - use 'slide statement' to move dependency call to the boundary
   - do identify what code is 'easy-to-test' and what is 'hard-to-test', test the easy-to-test part.

3. schedule-converter:
   - reading a file in unit test makes it slow, and we want to get rid of this.
   - "Extract something somewhere" and make the easy test

..and so on and so forth.
