### Step 4 - Connections: Refresh the page

_Solo, ~2 minutes. Answer **before** you read Concepts - a gut guess is fine._

After Step 3, sessions lived in memory on the orchestrator. **What happens to the board if you refresh the page?**
Why would putting sessions in **IndexedDB** change that?

> ___ 

_(You will revisit this in Conclusions.)_

### Step 4 - Connections: Orchestrator from Step 3

_Solo, ~5 minutes._

In Step 3, `cfb-board-orchestrator` held `#sessions` and pushed `data-sessions` down. In this
step it **does not** hold session rows that way.

**List what the orchestrator still does here vs Step 3.** Then answer: **what would be “too much” responsibility** for
the orchestrator in a larger app? (One short paragraph.)

_Solo, ~3 minutes._

In one or two sentences: what stayed the same in the **event-up / attribute-down** idea from Step 3, and
what changed now that **IndexedDB** exists?

**A)** Where else have you seen **client-side persistence** (mobile, desktop, another web app)? One line.

> ___

**B)** When is **localStorage** enough, and when would you reach for **IndexedDB** instead? One or two sentences.

### Step 4 - Concepts: One-minute review

_After reading the README Concepts sections - ~1 minute._

In two bullets: **who reads IndexedDB** in this step’s architecture - and **who must not** mix UI and raw IDB calls?

> ___

<a id="step-4-concept-quiz"></a>

### Step 4 - Concept check: Mini quiz

_Answer from memory first; then peek at [`session-store.js`](./session-store.js) or [`events.js`](./events.js) if needed._

1. In this repo, what `DB_NAME` constant does [`session-store.js`](./session-store.js) use when opening the database?

   >  ___

2. Why keep **`openDb` / `saveSessions` / `getAllSessions`** in `session-store.js` instead of calling
   `indexedDB.open` directly inside `cfb-schedule`?

   >  ___

3. After data is ready in IndexedDB, `cfb-session-loader` dispatches which **event type string**?
   *(See [`events.js`](./events.js).)*

   >  ___

1. Name **two files** that **import** from `session-store.js` (or list two consumers of `getAllSessions`).

   > ___

2. What attribute does `cfb-board-orchestrator` set on `listens-schedule-updates` schedules, and why is it a
   **timestamp** rather than the full session array?

   > ___
