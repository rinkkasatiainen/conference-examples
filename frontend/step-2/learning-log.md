# Learning log - Step 2

Use this file while you work through [Step 2 README](./README.md). When you finish the step, add your **key takeaway** in the [journey hub `learning-log.md`](../learning-log.md#step-2-key-takeaway).

### Step 2 - Connections: Where does session data live?

_Solo, ~2 minutes. Answer **before** you read the Concepts section._

For `<cfb-session-card>`, where does the session payload “live” while you are building this step?
Pick one gut answer - attributes only / JavaScript fields on the class / both - and one short reason.

> 

_(You will revisit this in Conclusions.)_

### Step 2 - Connections: Bridge from Step 1

_Solo, ~3 minutes._

Open [your Step 1](../step-1/index.html) board or [`../step-1/index.html`](../step-1/index.html). Look at one `<cfb-tag>`.

**How do you integrate the `<cfb-tag>` into the `<cfb-session-card>`? How would that look like in code?**

### Step 2 - Connections: Surprise (solo or pair)

_~3 minutes._

If solo: one sentence - *The hardest part of composing components for me will be ___.*
If you discussed with a peer: what one sentence did each of you take away?

### Step 2 - Connections: Topic link

_Solo, ~2 minutes. Answer **A** or **B** - not both._

**A)** Name a composite UI you built before (card, list row, form section). What did the parent own vs the children?

>

**B)** Skim [your Step 1 learning log](../step-1/learning-log.md). In one sentence: how does “what `<cfb-tag>` owns” extend to what `<cfb-session-card>` should own?

### Step 2 - Concepts: One-minute review

_After reading the README Concepts section - ~1 minute._

In three bullets or less: what is **one** thing a molecule may do that an atom should not?

<a id="step-2-myth-or-fact"></a>

### Step 2 - Concepts: Myth or fact (composition + data)

_Mark **M** (myth) or **F** (fact) first; then correct mistakes in one line each._

1. Composing `<cfb-tag>` inside `<cfb-session-card>` means the card script must imperatively create each tag with
   `document.createElement`.

   - Your first guess (M/F): ___
   - Correction / note: ___

2. Passing session data as JSON on a single `data-session-details` attribute is a valid pattern for structured props
   (keeping payload size reasonable).

   - Your first guess (M/F): ___
   - Correction / note: ___

3. Attendee rows should use a **rich shape** - e.g. `{ "name": string, "initials": string }` - so the footer can show
   initials and expose full names to assistive labels.

   - Your first guess (M/F): ___
   - Correction / note: ___

4. In Step 2, this molecule should call `fetch()` to load the conference schedule from an API.

   - Your first guess (M/F): ___
   - Correction / note: ___

5. Composing smaller custom elements into a larger one generally **reduces duplicated markup** across the board compared
   to pasting the same HTML in every column.

   - Your first guess (M/F): ___
   - Correction / note: ___

### Step 2 - Concrete Practice: One minute review

_Solo, 3 minutes: What Surprised you in building your first molecule? What struggles you had?

[← Back to README - 4) Conclusions](./README.md#4-conclusions)

<a id="step-2-true-false-composition"></a>

### Step 2 - Conclusions: Myth or Fact

_Complete in one line._

**Myth or Fact:** “Composing components reduces duplicated markup.”

- Your answer (M/F): ___
- Why (one sentence): ___

---

<a id="step-2-loop-back-data"></a>

### Step 2 - Conclusions: Loop back - where data lives

_Look at your answer under “Where does session data live?” above. Update in one line if needed._

>

---

### Step 2 - Conclusions: your myth or fact for the facilitator

_Solo, ~5 minutes._

1. Write **one** myth-or-fact style statement about **composition**, **JSON `data-*` attributes**, or **parent→child data flow** - something you are genuinely unsure about.

2. Ask your facilitator (PR, chat, sync): *“Myth or fact: …?”*

**My myth/fact question**

>

**Facilitator reply** _(or your notes after you asked)_
