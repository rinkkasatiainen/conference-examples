# Step 3 - `<cfb-board-orchestrator>` · Pub/Sub

In Step 2 you rendered one **molecule** (`<cfb-session-card>`) from session data. Now the board becomes **live**: a
control can announce “new session” and **other** components update - **without** importing each other’s classes.

> **This is the hinge of the whole track.** Up to here, components were wired to each other directly. From here on they
> only ever talk **through the DOM** — events bubble **up**, attributes push state **down** — and *nothing* imports
> anything else. Every later step (IndexedDB in 4, forms in 5–6, `fetch` in 7, WebSocket in 8) is just a **new source**
> plugged into this same decoupled pipeline. Get this step, and Steps 4–8 are variations on one theme. Its testing
> mirror, [T-3](../test-3/README.md), is the same hinge from the other side: it's where you start testing the
> **contract between** components instead of one component alone.

This step is about **events bubbling up** and **state pushed down** through attributes. The exact event name, payload
shape, and wiring live in **Concepts** and **`events.js`** - after you’ve done **Connections** - so your first guesses
in the learning log stay honest.

> **Before you start:** branch, HTTP server, clean console - see [getting-started.md](./getting-started.md).

### Async / solo

These challenges are written for **async, often solo** work. Use [your Step 3 learning log](./learning-log.md), a short
message to your facilitator or team, or a brief sync when the README says “pair.” **Short timeboxes** matter more than
the format.

---

## Learning goal

By the end of this step, you can:

- Dispatch a **`CustomEvent`** that **bubbles** so a deep child can signal an ancestor **without imports**.
- Implement an **orchestrator** that listens on itself, keeps internal state of  **`#sessions`**, and pushes
  **`data-sessions`** down to `<cfb-schedule>`.
- Explain why **`observedAttributes` + `attributeChangedCallback`** act like simple **parent → child** data binding for
  the schedule.
- Implement event-driven pub/sub with bubbling events and orchestrator coordinating state changes based on the events.

## 2) Concepts

HTML is by default a pub/sub system. An HTML element can publish an event while any other HTML element up the tree can
listen for it. To pass data down from a parent to a child, the parent can always find a child, e.g. by its id or class.
When a parent has a reference to a child, it can pass data down to the child via **attributes** (what we have done the
previous steps).

### Events up, state down

To publish an event, a component calls **`dispatchEvent`** on itself. To listen for an event, an ancestor element calls
**`addEventListener`** on itself with reference to the event type.

In short in this exercise (see [index.html](./index.html) for the HTML stcuture:

- **Event bubbles up:** [`CfbSessionGenerator`](cfb-session-generator.js) calls **`dispatchEvent`** on itself with a
  `cfbSessionCreated` event. The event walks toward `document`;
  The [`CfbBoardOrchestrator`](cfb-board-orchestrator.js) listens for `cfb-session-created` events and acts on the
  event.'
- **Handling the event:** The orchestrator listens to the event, and whenever it sees a new session added to the
  schedule, it needs to do few things:
    - it calls `preventDefault()` to prevent the default browser behavior, and `stopPropagation()` to prevent the event
      from bubbling up to the document. (these are not necessary calls, but serves here as example)
    - it adds the session to the internal **`#sessions`** array. ...and
    - it updates the **`data-sessions`** attribute on `<cfb-schedule>` with the new array, which is the next step in the
      flow.
- **State pushed down:** the orchestrator keeps track of *sessions* locally and whenever an incoming event triggers the
  event listener, it pushes the state down to [`CfbSchedule`](cfb-schedule.js) by changing the **`data-sessions`**
  attribute. The schedule declares **`observedAttributes`** and **re-renders** when that attribute changes.

---
**Note!**

> Note how the CfbSchedule has no direct reference to [CfbSessionCard](../step-2/cfb-session-card.js) from Step-2, but
> it just works by adding `<cfb-session-card data-session-details='${sessionJson}'></cfb-session-card>` into the HTML.
> (this is the magic of the custom web components and registering them.)
---

Neither the generator nor the schedule needs to **`import`** the orchestrator’s class. The **DOM tree** is the wiring
that is part of the **pub/sub** system.

### The event details: `sessionDetails` and `cfb-session-created`

From this exercise onwards, we're having a session data shape as follows (and this resembles the contract
between frontend and backend in these exercises):

```typescript
 {
    id: string
    title: string
    day: string
    room: string
    tags: Array<string>
    attendees: Array<{ initials: string, name: string }>
    sessionFormat: string
}
```

In [lib](./lib) folder, there are two related files, [`events.js`](./lib/events.js) and
[`builds-session-details.js`](./lib/builds-session-details.js). What you see here is two different responsibilities. A
helper function to create the agreed custom event which is uses the other helper function to create valid payload shape
for the event.

The pattern of building sessionDetails and event through factories is a good pattern to make sure the shape of the data
is consistent and easy to maintain. In [test-3](../test-3/README.md), this pattern is used to make contract tests. In
that test-step, we'll learn to test the shape of the return value of
[`generateRandomSession`](./lib/generate-random-session.js). In theory, already in this step we are defining a
contract (shape of the session-details), but let's learn one step at a time.

#### Building event details

To build the details of a session, it's useful to have a factory function that will build the shape of the data with
good default values (if any). This is done in [`builds-session-details.js`](./lib/builds-session-details.js). It does
not have any validation, but does create a valid session shape with a default id.

see [builds-session-details](./lib/builds-session-details.js) for more details. This too, is tested in 'test-3'

#### Buidling the event

For events, it's useful to have a factory function to guarantee valid shape of events. To build a custom event, it needs
a type and payload. The first parameter is the type, and the second contains the payload and other important properties.

The shape of a custom event is:

 ```javascript
new CustomEvent("EventName", {
  /* Event properties */
  bubbles: true, // This is crucial for the pub/sub system to work
  /* The 'detail' property is a custom key that holds the payload */
  detail: { /* the payload */ }
})
```

This repo uses [`events.js`](./lib/events.js) to build the event:

- it exports a function `cfbSessionCreated` that takes _data_ as parameter, and returns a `CustomEvent` with type of
  `EventTypes.SESSION_CREATED` and follows a shape of the CustomEvents described above. It also makes sure that the
  detail is build with the event details factory method.
- the `_type` field of the `detail` is set to same as the type of the custom event. Even though this might seem like
  unnecessary payload, there might be situations where 'event type' and 'event name' are not 1:1.

### End-to-end flow (reference)

From this step onwards, web components are talking with each other more dynamically. For that reason, let's draw a '
end-2-end' flow for this situation.

In this flow, it starts when you click the 'Add random session' button.

Legend:

- [ ] ✨ you implement / finish
- [ ] 🚧 partly provided
- [ ] ✅ read & trace for understanding

```
[Click “Add random session”]
        │
        ▼
✨ cfb-session-generator
  dispatches cfb-session-created { bubbles: true, composed: true }
  detail: sessionDetails(session) + _type
        │  bubbles UP
        ▼
🚧 cfb-board-orchestrator
  ✨ listens for cfb-session-created
  ✨ pushes session into local #sessions variable
  ✨ sets data-sessions='[…]' on <cfb-schedule class="cfb-updates-schedule">
        │  attribute goes DOWN
        ▼
✅ cfb-schedule
  observedAttributes → data-sessions
  parses JSON → groups by day → renders <cfb-session-card> per session
```

### Orchestrator role

- The orchestrator has **one job:** to coordinate data flow - it merges incoming sessions and **fan out** changes to
  state to `CfbSchedule` element(s) via **attributes**.
- The orchestrator **does not** know about the schedule - it must not have any reference to it. In best case,
  orchestrator does not even know of the name of the element.

Think this as like orchestrator is totally different capability than that of schedule. Schedule could be in a capability
called _Session Discovery_ while orchestrator might live in _Session Tracking_. If these lives in different business
capabilities, they should not know of the existenc of each other. Then, they must **agree on a class name** or such for
`Schedule` to (sort of) register the updates from `Orchestrator`.

More on busines capabilities in one of the extra challenges (to be done later).

### Listener hygiene

Use a **stable** function reference for **`addEventListener`** / **`removeEventListener`** (e.g. a **bound** method or
a **class field with fat arrow**). Remove listeners in **`disconnectedCallback`** to avoid memory leaks. This is one of
the drawbacks of Javascript and custom elements - how `this` is bound in functions. More about this in
the [Tips](./tips.md)

### One-minute review (~1 min)

After reading the sections above, complete [One-minute review](./learning-log.md#step-3-concepts-one-minute) in your
learning log.

---

### Concept check

Do **two** short activities in your [learning log](./learning-log.md).

1. **Mini quiz** - Open [Mini quiz](./learning-log.md#step-3-concept-quiz) and answer the three questions there *before*
   you rely on copy-paste from the source files.

When both are done, move on to **Concrete practice**.

## 3) Concrete practice

Now it's time to make the pub/sub board live. To have a live board -> where you can add new (random) sessions

### Files to work in

| File                                                       | Role                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`cfb-session-generator.js`](./cfb-session-generator.js)   | Button → **`cfbSessionCreated`** with random session data                                             |
| [`cfb-board-orchestrator.js`](./cfb-board-orchestrator.js) | Listen · maintain **`#sessions`** · **`setAttribute('data-sessions', …)`** on `.cfb-updates-schedule` |
| [`cfb-schedule.js`](./cfb-schedule.js)                     | **Read** implementation: **`data-sessions`**, grouping, cards                                         |

Build so you can **show**:

- [ ] **`cfb-session-generator`**: button in **`connectedCallback`**; click builds a session
  (use **`generateRandomSession`**) and dispatches **`cfbSessionCreated(...)`** from **`events.js`**
- [ ] **`cfb-board-orchestrator`**: register a listener on **self** for **`EventTypes.SESSION_CREATED`** (event string
  **`cfb-session-created`**); on each event, append to **`#sessions`** and set **`data-sessions`** on
  **`querySelectorAll('.cfb-updates-schedule')`**.
- [ ] **Remove** the same listener in **`disconnectedCallback`**.
- [ ] **`cfb-schedule`**: trace **`observedAttributes`**, **`attributeChangedCallback`**, **`#render`**, and how it
  emits **`<cfb-session-card data-session-details='…'>`**.

**Constraints**

- HTML, JavaScript, and (optionally) CSS only - no frameworks.
- Aim for about **30–45 minutes** on the core challenge.

**Definition of done**

- Clicking **Add random session** adds a visible card (or updates the list) **without** any component `import`ing
  another’s class for wiring.
- **`data-sessions`** on `<cfb-schedule>` updates and the schedule re-renders.
- You can name the event type **`cfb-session-created`** and point to **`sessionDetails`** / **`events.js`** in one
  sentence.

### 1) Quick check

Answer in [your learning log - Quick check](./learning-log.md#step-3-conclusions-quick-check):

- Where is **`cfb-session-created`** defined, and who **dispatches** it?
- In one line: what travels **up** vs **down** in this step?

### 2) Loop back

Update [How does the button reach the board?](./learning-log.md#step-3-loop-back-notify).

### 3) Key takeaway (journey hub)

Add **one or two sentences** in the [journey hub `learning-log.md`](../learning-log.md#step-3-key-takeaway).

### Demos / issues

- Share a short screen recording or a [CodePen](https://codepen.io) link if you want feedback.
- If you get stuck, note it in your learning log or ping your facilitator.

## Extras

If you finish early:

- [ ] Dispatch **`sessionsCleared`** (or similar); orchestrator resets **`#sessions`** and pushes **`[]`** down.
- [ ] Animate new cards with **`@keyframes`** when a card appears.
- [ ] A small **session count** badge elsewhere: listen for **`cfb-session-created`** without importing the
  orchestrator.
- [ ] Compare this in-memory list with **Step 4** (IndexedDB): what does persistence buy you?
- [ ] **Self-study (optional, not part of this step’s scope):** Dig into how **`this`** is bound in JavaScript - plain
  functions vs **arrow functions**, **`.bind(this)`**, and object methods. It explains why **`removeEventListener`**
  must receive the **same** function reference you passed to **`addEventListener`
  ** ([listener hygiene above](#stable-listener-references)). [MDN:
  `this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) is a solid starting point.

---

### End result (skills you can demonstrate)

- **`CustomEvent`** + **`cfb-session-created`** with **`bubbles: true`** / **`composed: true`**
- **Orchestrator / mediator** - coordinate without coupling class names
- **Push state down** via **`data-sessions`** + **`attributeChangedCallback`**
- **Clean teardown** - **`removeEventListener`** in **`disconnectedCallback`**
- **`sessionDetails`** as the shared session shape from **`events.js`**
