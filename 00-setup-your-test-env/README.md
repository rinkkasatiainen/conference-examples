# Setup your test env.

**Learning goal**: Having your dev env ready for the upcoming training sessions.

Welcome to the Conference Examples exercises. The main goal for this is to make sure you have your environment setup 
correctly so that we can get on with the exercises. It consists of one to four steps 

- running tests
- (optionally) running linting
- (if on remote training) setting up mob.sh and
- (optionally) doing a [FizzBuzz kata](https://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata)

## Setting up your environment and running tests

Read instructions on respective folder
- [javascript](./javascript/README.md#setup)

once that is done, make the test green (by fixing production code, not test) and run tests again.

## setup [mob.sh](https://mob.sh/)

Really, do this. Especially if attending a remote cohort. For Windows, I used _scoop_ and on mac _homebrew_

## Do the FizzBuzz kata.

This is just to get your hands into keyboard, and into TDD flow. There is a test list ready in the specific
language that you choose. Implemen one test case at a time, make sure you are always green. 

## Finished?
