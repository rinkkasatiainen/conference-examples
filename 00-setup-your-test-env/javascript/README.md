## Setup

Run `yarn` (or `npm install`)

That should install all the necessary dependencies

Run `yarn lint` (or `npm run lint`)

That should show one warning: 

```
eslint -- src test

[...]/00-setup-your-test-env/javascript/test/fizzbuzz.test.js
  1:24  warning  Unexpected pending mocha test  mocha/no-pending-tests

✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)

✨  Done in 1.18s.
```

and run `yarn test`

and you should see one failing test. Make it green, run again and have only green tests.

## Finished?
